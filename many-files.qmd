title: "Many files"

It can be a challenge to face many files to work with.  Often they are scattered across a number of directories, and it can be tempting for a novice to manually read each one.  This is a moment to leverage the fast and relatively easy tools available to you for finding, reading and binding various data sets.



Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
