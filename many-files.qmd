It can be a challenge to face many files to work with.  Often they are scattered across a number of directories, and it can be tempting for a novice to manually read each one.  This is a moment to leverage the fast and relatively easy tools available to you for finding, reading and binding various data sets.

Worse, sometimes files can less than cooperative for new coders by having complicated or non-standard layouts. 

And, of course, invariably we want do handle the contents of the files as *one* object, rather than one object per file.  

In this tutorial we walk through some of the techniques available to the coder to simplify the steps to importing multi-file datasets into R (or python!)

## Mocked data

We have prepared a mock up of a dataset.  It consists of studies of guppies from 5 sites. At each site we generate two files: a ["gup" data file](data/guppy/site_01/site_01.gup) and a ["YAML" metadata file](data/guppy/site_01/site_01.yaml).  Each is a text file, but the `.gup` file consists of two parts: a header is a quasi-yaml format followed by the a CSV style table of data.
