## Indexing a list in a chain of pipes

Suppose we have a list, l, containing three lowercase characters

```{r}
l <- list("a", "b", "c")

l
```

To index an element of the list, we can use double square brackets

```{r}
l[[1]]
```

If we want to index the same element as part of a chain of pipes, the new pipe operator (`|>`) won't cut it

```{r}
#| error: true
l |> `[[`(1)
```

The old pipe (`%>%`) still works, but requires loading dplyr and doesn't look very elegant

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
l %>% `[[`(1)
```

Instead, we can use `getElement()`. Supply the list as the first argument, and the index as the second

```{r}
getElement(l, 1)
```

Here's an example of indexing the first element and making it upper case

```{r}
l |>
  getElement(1) |>
  toupper()
```
